HOLY FUCKING SHIT.

For three hours I was debugging and I finally got it. Wow.
Error:
Flashlight app was displaying just black

Bit of error searching: 
Error mapping resources: Invalid resource handle

Traced the error back to the cuda resource registering. It wasnt registering the buffer properly 
cudaGraphicsGLRegisterBuffer(&cuda_pbo_resource, pbo, cudaGraphicsMapFlagsWriteDiscard);

The buffer was properly created (something that took me 45 mins to verify painstakingly)
After console logging a lot of stuff and chatgpting the hell out of everything to understand what the fuck was going on...
I found a good ol' post on Nvidia's forum.
The likely culprit(after eliminating a bunch of others) was my openGL. 
It wasnt a driver compatibility or interop issue(something i spent a significant amount of brain power meticulously checking)
It was the fact that my openGL was creating it's context on the wrong gpu
I have an integrated Intel gpu and a discrete NVIDIA gpu. OpenGL was using the former to create it's context and that was fucking with everything.
So i forced it to use discrete gpu and boom, even my original code workedd without any modification necessary

Remember to use this to force opengl to open its context using the nvidia gpu

export __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1
export __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia
./main.exe
